                                <h2>Organizing an international conference ACIIDS 2016 on intelligent information and database systems</h2>
                                <div>
                                    <p>In March 14- 16, 2016, Korea-Vietnam Friendship Information Technology College and the Wroclaw University will jointly organize the 8th ACIIDS international Asian conference on intelligent information and database systems. This is an international conference welcoming the attendance and contribution of many scientists inside and outside the country. With the prestige built over many periods of organization, this conference honourably receives the award and congratulatory letter from the Deputy Prime Minister of Poland and the congratulatory letter from the Prime Minister of the Vietnamese Ministry of Information and Communications. The leaders of the Vietnamese Ministry of Information and Communications, the leaders of Wroclaw University in Poland, the universities inside and outside the country, the leaders of local agencies and departments and especially many top-world scientists and researchers interested in this field, all attend the conference.</p>
                                    <p>In this era of information technology, the explosion of intelligent systems has become apparent than ever. Human life is expected to change completely when people conquer technology and information. Realizing the importance of information technology, the leaders of the Vietnamese government insisted at WITFOR2009 World Information Technology Forum that "Currently, we are building strategies to accelerate Vietnam’s becoming powerful nation on information technology, with focus on the improvement of legal environment, modernizing information infrastructure, information technology industry development, promoting the application and development of information technology in socio-economic sectors, and paying special attention to the development of information technology human resources in large quantity and high quality". Along with the introduction of the Resolution 36 of the Politburo on promoting the application and development of information technology to meet the requirements of sustainability development and international integration, the information and technology of Vietnam is given more strength and motivation than ever to complete the national mission and contribute to the growth of the country in the period of international economic integration.</p>
                                    <p>In this spirit, the Korea-Vietnam Friendship Information Technology College, which is a public school under the Ministry of Information and Communications, with training in information technology sectors, along with the Wroclaw University will jointly organize the 8th ACIIDS Asian conference on intelligent information and database systems. The conference will involve the technical support of the prestigious universities in the country and in the world such as Bina Nusantara University, Indonesia, Ton Duc Thang University, Quang Binh University, Technical Association of artificial intelligent automatic control systems IEEE SMC. The conference is a valuable opportunity for local and foreign researchers interested in this field to exchange, learn and share experience, raise awareness about the importance of intelligent information and database system, contributing to the development of Vietnam’s information technology in the integration period. The conference is also a bridge between the scientists in the world, especially Asia, and the experts, scientists, and managers in Vietnam in the cooperation of research and implementation of projects relating to this field.</p>
                                    <p>The Asian Conference on Intelligent Information and Database Systems (ACIIDS) was held for the first time in 2009. Over 8 times of organization, the conference has built a reputation in the world of scientific research in the country and in the world. The conference’s good quality articles are published in the publication “Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence LNCS / LNAI” by prestigious Springer publisher.</p>
                                    <p><b>Organization scale and conference content</b></p>

                                    <p>- Intelligent Information Systems: Distributed artificial intelligence; Intelligent multi-element system; Parallel computing; Software Technology...</p>
                                    <p>- Intelligent Database Systems: Data warehouse; Data mining; Big Data; Peer and mobile database; Object-oriented and relationship-oriented database ....</p>
                                    <p>- Applications and tools: Collaborative learning systems; Enterprise integration and supply chain systems; E-commerce systems, Electronic finance ....</p>
                                    <p>The conference recognizes up to 190 scientific articles among which more than 150 are oral presentation and 40 are poster presentation and these are presented during the 3 days from 14-16 March 2016. The reports are topically classified to facilitate the monitoring of the conference attendants.</p>
                                    <p>In particular, the ACIIDS 2016 has the participation of the four renowned scientists from HongKong, Australia, Poland and Taiwan with presentations on the topics of concern in the field of information technology such as (1) The approach optimizing neurodynamic set to factorize non-negative matrix; (2) Simulation and modeling of large complex systems; (3) Big Data in modern linguistics research. Researching the optimal methods for linguistics chronicles; (4) Increasing and multi-source data mining. This is a good opportunity for the researchers in the country and in Asia to access new technologies as well and to gain orientation for their scientific research activities.</p>
                                    <p>Besides, in panel discussion, the participants also have the opportunity to listen to Professor Nguyen Ngoc Thanh - The scientist awarded the title of Professor of Poland and Vietnam - one of the scientists from the University of Wroclaw, making presentation on the development trends of intelligent information and database systems in the future.</p>
                                    <p>After the presentations and discussions, the participants of the conference will have a chance to visit some places like the campus of the Vietnam - Korea Friendship Information Technology College, The Marble Mountain and the Hoi An Ancient Town.</p>
